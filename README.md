This software package facilitates the process of generating insights from the Australian Education and Employment data. Specifically the software in this repository describes how we identified : “52% of Australians had completed Year 12 or equivalent in 2016.” 

The Australian Education and Employment data was collected from ABS-education-and-employment-1410.0 (10.5281/zenodo.4939843)  Zenodo repository that stores information about education and employment in Australia between 2014 and 2019. We created a Jupyter Notebook called “prepare_and_setup.ipynb” to read this data and extract the insight.
